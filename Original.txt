Basketball and soccer are played with a round ball.  They both provide a
ton of cardiovascular exercise such as running; so if you want
to get in shape these are the sports to play.  A referee judges each
game.  When a player breaks the rules he or she is called for a foul. A
soccer player receives a red or yellow card and a basketball player is
called for a foul.  Finally a score is kept in each game.  The team with
the highest score wins.

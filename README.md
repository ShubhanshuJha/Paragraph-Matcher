## About the repository:

This is a ``Python`` program that help you to compare two different text files.
Also, it will store the output in text files. The program basically does the comparison
based on four parameters: `right`, `wrong`, `missed`, and `left` words, and the output
from each of the parameters are being saved in `Right_Words_List.txt`, `Wrong_Words_List.txt`,
`Missed_Words_List.txt`, and `Left_Words_List.txt` respectively, i.e. the file `Right_Words_List.txt`
will contain only those word/collection of words that are in both the files, `Wrong_Words_List.txt`
will have only those word/words that are in the `InputFile` but not in the `OriginalFile`,
similarly `Missed_Words_List.txt` will have the list of word/s that in the `OriginalFile` but
not in the `InputFile`, and `Left_Words_List.txt` will contain those words of `OriginalFile` that
remained uncompared.
